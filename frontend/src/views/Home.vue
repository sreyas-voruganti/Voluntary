          Welcome to Voluntary v0.1 Beta! Keep in mind that we're in early beta
          and may have bugs and/or missing features which may be reported

          volunteer hours, and the answer to that is yes. We are a nonprofit
          organization and therefore can certify volunteer hours. All
          information regarding this can be found through the
          <span class="has-text-weight-medium">Your Contributions</span>
          section from your profile. Please keep in mind that we do
          <span class="has-text-weight-medium">not</span> allow adult-rated
          content on this site.

          If you want to mentor, first create a service. You will be contacted
          by interested clients, decide on a meeting time and have a session
          with them. After the session is complete, ask your client to submit a
          session claim from your service page. Then make sure you verify it by
          clicking <strong>View Your Sessions</strong>, then your session has
          officially been recorded and can be seen through your contributions
          section.
